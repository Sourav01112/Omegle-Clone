          You don't need an app to use Omegle on your phone or tablet! The web
          site works great on mobile.

          Omegle (oh·meg·ull) is a great way to meet new friends. When you use
          Omegle, you are paired randomly with another person to talk
          one-on-one. If you prefer, you can add your interests and you`ll be
          randomly paired with someone who selected some of the same interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell someone who
          you are (not recommended!), and you can stop a chat at any time. See
          our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines for more info about the
          do`s and don`ts in using Omegle. Omegle video chat is moderated but no
          moderation is perfect. Users are solely responsible for their behavior
          while using Omegle.
        </p>
        <p>
          YOU MUST BE 18 OR OLDER TO USE OMEGLE. See Omegle`s Terms of Service
          for more info. Parental control protections that may assist parents
          are commercially available and you can find more info at
          https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/ as well as other sites.
